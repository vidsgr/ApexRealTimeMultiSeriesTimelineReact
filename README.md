This tiny project demonstrates how to draw realtime multiseries charts using ApexCharts. 
The demo offered at their website does not really have multiple series. And 'datetime' option
for xaxis does not help either if you want to draw datapoints well within 5 minutes space. 

I have used "catagories" option for xaxis, added few custom formatter to not overcrowd labels.
And pushing time data as "LocaleString". 

I hope it helps.
